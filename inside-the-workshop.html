    <h2>Thimphu Thangka Conservation Workshop</h2>
    <p>In 2005, the Thimphu Thangka Conservation Workshop was founded by Ephraim &quot;Eddie&quot; Jose, where monks currently train and work to conserve the thangkas of their temples and monasteries to the highest professional standard. The workshop is a non-profit organisation which relies on donations and conservation work done by the studio.</p>

    <p>The daughter of HRH Princess Pem Pem Wangchuck,  Ashi Kesang Choden, works together with the Central Monastic Body of Bhutan to preserve the sacred artworks of the Kingdom. She dedicates herself to working in the Thimphu Thangka Conservation Workshop to restore the sacred artworks. Ashi holds a lot of spiritual feeling for her country and its people, so the act of restoring the thangkas is a form of giving back to Bhutan and its future generations.</p>
